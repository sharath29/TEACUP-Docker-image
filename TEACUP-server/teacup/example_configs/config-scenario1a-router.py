# List of router queues/pipes
#
#
# $Id$

# Each entry is a tuple. The first value is the queue number and the second value
# is a comma separated list of parameters (see routersetup.py:init_pipe()).
# Queue numbers must be unique.

# Note that variable parameters must be either constants or or variable names
# defined by the experimenter. Variables are evaluated during runtime. Variable
# names must start with a 'V_'. Parameter names can only contain numbes, letter
# (upper and lower case), underscores (_), and hypen/minus (-).

# All variables must be defined in TPCONF_variable_list (see below).

# Note parameters must be configured appropriately for the router OS, e.g. there
# is no CoDel on FreeBSD; otherwise the experiment will abort witn an error.

TPCONF_router_queues = [
    # Set same delay for every host
