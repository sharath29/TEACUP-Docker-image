This is README of nttcp-1.4:

This program is a much more convenient version of the ttcp program.
It uses inetd (or simulates its behaviour) to start off the remote
side program which will send/receive data. Both sides measure the time
and number of bytes transfered. The local side will print the measures.
The format of the output can be specified on the commandline.
==> More info can be found in the manpage nttcp.1 -- especially in the
    section INSTALLATION.

For a first try you may simply call: make. 
If this does not work, look for an option setting suitable for your
operating system / compiler. Set this from the commandline or from
the Makefile (I prefer to set ARCH, OPT, DBG from the commandline).
If nothing works, let me know. You may tell me also if it
works!
