This is a modified version of nttcp 1.47 
for CAIA's TCP Experiment Automation Controlled Using Python (TEACUP)
(http://www.caia.swin.edu.au/tools/teacup).

It has the following modifications:
- modified timeout value when checking the TCP socket
  (changed from 10s to 1s, because otherwise it could cause 10s delay 
   at the start of an experiment)
