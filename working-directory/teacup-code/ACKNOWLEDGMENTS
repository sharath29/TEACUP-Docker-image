TEACUP versions prior to 1.0 were developed as part of a project
funded by Cisco Systems and titled "Study in TCP Congestion Control
Performance In A Data Centre". This was a collaborative effort between
Swinburne University of Technology's Centre for Advanced Internet
Architectures and Fred Baker of Cisco Systems. These may
be found at http://caia.swin.edu.au/tools/teacup/downloads.html

Starting with TEACUP v1.0, development will be community supported
and publicly hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/teacup/
