Version 1.1 (XXX)
-----------------
- Fixed error in comment (TCP send buffer setup related)
- Turn off socket receive buffer tuning by default on FreeBSD now (was already
  off by default on Linux)
- Added ttprobe logger support, called ttprobe. Logger can be 
  changed by adding TPCONF_linux_tcp_logger = <logger> to config.py
  where logger can be 'web10g' , 'ttprobe' or 'both'. If 'both' is
  used during the experiment, we can select which logger will be used
  by setting LINUX_TCP_LOGGER environment variable to the desired logger
  name.   
- Added stime and etime parameters for analyse_2d_density method, so we can
  plot data for specific time windows 
- Some changes to allow running analysis functions in a directory without
  write access: 
  - oldconfig.py files are now created in /tmp
  - don't crash when trying to write to a cache file that is read-only
- Detect location of experiment files based on uname file
- Prepended a TC_ to all evironment variables used to communicate the
  plotting parameters. This should avoid clashes with existing variables
  such as bash's GROUPS (GROUPS cannot be overriden without prior unset).
- TPCONF_max_time_diff = 2 in all example configs to allow for higher
  time difference (VMs)
- broadcast ping enabled in all example configs now
- Prevent adding empty entries in flow cache (could happen if analysis
  was run with tcpdump not in path)
- Imported CAIA Technical Report source under CC-BY-SA-4.0 for TEACUP
- Imported CAIA Technical Report source under CC-BY-SA-4.0 for TEAPLOT
- Imported TEAPLOT 0.1.1 source for 2D and 3D animation
- Imported http://caia.swin.edu.au/tools/teacup/downloads/teacup-dash-patch-0.2.tgz
	to enable generation of DASH traffic using dash.js inside a browser
- Updated teaplot ('fab animate') to version 0.2 (see ./animate/ChangeLog.teaplot)

Version 1.0 (26th May 2015)
---------------------------
- Fixed time series plot so that if we have more than 12 flows (more than one
  pdf) the start time for each graph is the experiment start time
- Added SORT_FLOWS_BY_START_TIME, which if set to '1' will sort flows by start 
  time in a time series plot
- Restructured data analysis code
- Extended init_topology, so it works with multiple routers
- Extended check_connectivity so it works with disjoint subnets
- Added TPCONF_check_connectivity. if set to '1' (default) connectivity check is
  done before each experiment. if set to '0' there is no connectivity check.
- Removed bogus warning that could appear during clockoffset computation
- Modified init_toplogy for FreeBSD, so we get our default route back after
  reconfiguring the test interface and static route
- Fixed bug in Windows host setup introduced in version 0.9.3
- Code cleanup and little fixes
- Changed default experiment ID prefix to: 'exp_' + now.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
  If you want to analyse experiment data with the old experiment ID prefix in 
  file names with analyse_cmpexp or analyse_2d_density, you must specify 
  test_id_prefix='[0-9]{8}\-[0-9]{6}_experiment_' as parameter.

Version 0.9.3 (6th May 2015)
----------------------------
- Fixed wrong pdf file names for some analysis functions when multiple test 
  IDs are specified
- Extended init_os, so we can reboot non-resposnsive host(s) into a desired
  operating system. User must specify MAC addresses of control/boot interfaces
  of the hosts with the new parameter mac_list. Of course this only works if
  a supported power controller is installed and configured for teacup, so 
  teacup can power cycle the host(s).
- Fixed bug in analyse functions that caused some flows not to be plotted
  when function was called with a list of more than one test id
- Added packet loss analysis function (ONLY works for game traffic thus far)
- Fixed bug that plotted the same flow twice in one graph, in case we specify 
  two (or more) source filters with the same IP and port (irrespective of 
  whether they are S_ or D_ filters)
- Added FILTER_FLOWS environment variable for time series plots. if set to 1, 
  all flows that were not active will be filtered out. maybe this should be 
  the default behaviour in the future, for now I have added it via the variable.

Version 0.9.2 (28th April 2015)
-------------------------------
- Fixed extract_rtt and analyse_rtt so that if burst_sep = 0 then
  timestamps are not normalised before plotting for each flow individually,
  but plotting will normalise all timestamps based on the timestamp of the
  first packet during the experiments. Basically this restires the behaviour
  we had pre version 0.9. 
- Fixed extract_ackseq and analyse_ackseq accordingly (see last point)
- Added tags in code and script to generate code documentation with doxygen
- For analyse_2d_density replaced merge_xdata and merge_ydata with merge_data
- For burst-based analysis, instead of starting every burst at time zero,
  we now normalise the start time of burst n of flow f based on the start 
  time of the first burst n over all flows. this means if burst 1 of flow
  a start a bit later than burst 1 of flow b, we now see the gap in time. 
- Fixed bug in extract_rtt/analyse_rtt that causes wrong results if there
  are multiple flows between the same two hosts with the same server port
- Added client start delay parameter for game traffic generator
- Changed type of plot from "both" to "points" for analyse_dash_goodput
  so it is consistent with the other plot functions

Version 0.9.1 (17th April 2015)
-------------------------------
- Fixed bug in caching of hosts that participated in experiment
  (only occurs if processing experiments done with pre 0.9 versions)
- Fixed bug in extract_rtt that caused incorrect RTT estimates in plots

Version 0.9 (14th April 2015)
-----------------------------
- Fixed broken ack seq data extract with more than one test id
- Fixed broken/missing burst_seq type conversion in analyse_ackseq
- Added link speed setting for testbed interfaces on all hosts (except router).
  Speed can be set to 10, 100, 100 or auto (default) 
- added extract and plot method for incast inter-query times 
  (analyse_incast_iqtimes)
- added extract method for incast response times from tcpdump data
- Fixed broken ts_correct for analyse_rtt
- Timestamp correction is now enabled by default for all analysis functions
  (ts_correct=1). If no clock offsets file can be computed, e.g. because
  multicast ping was not enabled, a warning is printed and uncorrected 
  timestamps are used.
- Added logging for link speed setting on Windows
- Added response time as metric for analyse_cmpexp
- Added merge_data parameter for analsye_cmpexp that if set to '1'
  will merge data from different flows/responders into one dataset
- Added merge_xdata and merge_ydata parameters for analyse_2_density. if set
  to '1' will merge data from different flows/responders into one dataset for
  x-axis or y-axis data
- Removed defaults for variables for init_topology. Must set command line
  parameters or TPCONF variables. This is to protect against accidentally
  configuring wrong switch.
- Added multiple router support. TPCONF_router_queues can now be a dictionary
  indexed by router names (listed in TPCONF_router) and the values are
  of the same structure as TPCONF_router_queues. For backwards compatibility
  TPCONF_router_queues can also be defined as list of tuples as before.
- Optimised file finding with an experiment ID to directory cache (and also
  removed a superfluous "find" in clock offset correct function). The cache
  file is called teacup_dir_cache.txt and is created in the directory where
  fab is executed. Cache entries are never deleted, so if one renames directories
  or moves files, one should clear the whole cache by deleting the cache file 
  or by selectively removing entries from the cache file.
- allow absolute paths for out_dir, res_dir and pdf_dir
- removed local('which <executable>') tests in analyse.py
- added a way to specify the config file used. It can be specified using
  fab's --set parameter to set the env variable teacup_config as follows:
  fab --set teacup_config=config.py 
- fixed crash in analyse_incast_iqtimes when ts_correct=1
- added diff_to_burst_start parameter to analyse_incast_iqtimes, which allows 
  to select whether time gaps are from the start of bursts or between consecutive 
  packets
- support for iqtimes in analyse_cmpexp, limited to time gaps between
  consecutive packets. also data needs to be extracted beforhand as there
  is no query_host parameter for analyse_cmpexp yet.
- added sburst and eburst parameters for extract_incast and analyse_incast
  (not for tcpdump data though, only for httperf log extraction)
- added sburst and eburst parameters for analyse_cmpexp, so can be used
  for response times or ackseq
- fixed bug in analyse_cmpexp when group_by_prefix=1 that caused duplicate
  x-axis labels and the plot function to fail
- all varying parameters for a series of experiments are now logged in
  <test_id_pfx>_varying_params.log.gz files
- added TPCONF_pcap_snaplen parameter to configure the snaplen for
  tcpdump
- fixed incorrect x-axis max value for plot_time_series.R when plotting more
  than 12 series over multiple graphs
- added RTT burst plotting
- added total_per_experiment switch for analyse_throughput and extract_throughput
  if set to '1' plot aggregate throughput for all flows (selected with source_filter), 
  if set to '0' plot per-flow throughput (default)
- added analyse_goodput method to plot the goodput over time (goodput is
  back on ackseq data, not on sequence numbers in data packets)
- analyse_cmpexp does not read the varying parameters from config anymore. 
  instead it builds the list of varying parameters from the first test ID 
  given to the task. in order for this to work given that the test ID prefix 
  can be freely chosen, one must specify the test id prefix as regular exression 
  with the test_id_prefix parameter _if_ a non-default test ID prefix was used. 
  for example, the following would match the default test ID prefix: 
  test_id_prefix="[0-9]{8}\-[0-9]{6}_experiment_"  
- Fixed bug where teacup tried to open tcpdump files collected on hosts that did
  not actually participated in an experiment. List of participating hosts is
  automatically generated from the data files (uname files).
- added res_time_mode parameter for analyse_cmpexp. if set to
  1 teacup will plot the nominal/theorectial response time in addition to the
  observed response times. if set to 2 and ptype is 'median' or 'mean', teacup
  will plot the ratio of observed median/mean response time and nominal
  response time.  by default the variable is set to 0 (normal plot).
- added slowest_only parameter to analyse_cmpexp and analyse_2d_density
  to plot distributions over only the slowest responses in each burst
  (had to change file name for slowest response time data to make this work)
- added get_version task that prints out TEACUP version and SVN revision
  info and copyright. SVN revision is in VERSION when installing from tar.
  if no SVN revision in VERSION, then it will get the revision number from svn
  info if the source is a checked out copy. If neither installed from tar or
  checked out copy, then no SVN revision info will be printed.
- added envronment variable NO_BARS for analyse_cmpexp. if set to 1 for
  median/mean plots there will be points instead of bars. has no effect if
  boxplots are plotted.
- moved slowest_only computation for incast response times to extract_incast
  and extract_incast_restimes
- added another mode for slowest_only. if set to '2' it will compute the time
  between the first request sent and the time the last response finished for
  each burst.
- renamed extract_throughput to extract_pktsizes
- added flow cache for analysis tasks that extract data on a per flow basis.
  tasks will only extract flows again if not found in cache. the flow cache
  file is created in the fabfile directory is named teacup_flow_cache.txt 
- teacup will backup the config file in the experiment directory before an 
  experiment starts (it not only backs up config.py but also all sub config 
  files included via execfile). All config files are put in file
  <test_id_prefix>_config.tar.gz
- archive all TPCONF_ variables for series of experiments in file
  <test_id_prefix>_tpconf_vars.log.gz. if this file is present analysis methods
  will use it to check hostname to internal IP mappings etc. instead of
  config.py.
- archive host name to IP mapping at time of experiment in file
  <test_id_prefix>_nameip_map.log.gz
- changed get_clock_offsets so it also uses <test_id_prefix>_tpconf_vars.log.gz
  if available
- if broadcast ping is enabled but TPCONF_bc_ping_address is not specified
  the default multicast address 224.0.1.199 will be used
- fix: the period parameter for start_httperf_incast and start_httperf_incast_n
  can be a floating point number now

Version 0.8.1 (20th February 2015)
----------------------------------
- fixed abort if TPCONF_host_os has entry with host not actually used for
  experiment
- fixed bug in toplogy configuration if TPCONF_topology_switch_port_offset
  is undefined
- fixed broken TPCONF_bc_ping_enable 
- added start_httperf_incast_n traffic generator. This will start all the
  servers, create all the content and start the querier. It has the union
  set of parameters of start_http_server, generate_incast_content and
  start_httperf_incast plus the new parameter num_responders. The new
  parameter makes it possible to vary the number of responders.
- added analyse_2d_density function to plot 2d density or ellipses
- increased timeout for ssh connection used to configure switch
- restructured init_topology, so the switch configuration is performed
  serially (host by host) but the NIC/route configuration of the hosts is
  performed in parallel (all hosts at the same time)
- all the file finding functions (analyse) do follow symlinks now
- added cwnd and tcpstat metrics for analyse_cmpexp and analyse_2d_density
- separated analyse_ackseq into extract_ackseq and analyse_ackseq
- fixed adding trailing slash for analyse_cmpexp and analyse_2d_density
- fixed type bug in plot_incast_ACK_series, when sburst was passed as
  string
- fixed crash in web10g version guess when no web10g log files present
  (e.g. only SIFTR logs)
- Fixed bug when aggregating plot data with datasets that have more than
  two columns

Version 0.8 (February 2015)
---------------------------
- added parameter plot_script to all analyse tasks. This
  parameter allows to specify the script used for plotting. This 
  means one can implement custom plot scripts for different publications and then
  tell TEACUP which to use. If one uses a modified R script the syntax is as 
  follows: plot_script="R CMD BATCH --vanilla /home/test/my_plot_time_series.R" 
  The script (or R interpreter in the case of R) is called with one parameter,
  which is the path of a plot log file (the file is automatically removed
  however if TPCONF_debug_level = 0) 
- added parameter plot_params to all analyse_ tasks. The string assigned to this
  variable is passed unchanged to the R plot function, so this can be used to
  override parameters such as YLAB and YSCALER. Note that since goes through
  Fabric equal signs and quotes need to be escaped with backslash on the command
  line.
- added a killing of all processes at the end of an experiment, to cleanup
  after experiment. still we also do this at the start as it is never
  guaranteed that a previous experiment terminated properly
- added check for duplicate values in vary parameters to prevent later
  crash in this case
- fixed unsmoothed RTT for web10g version 2.0.9 
- number of columns in legend is now set to <3 if <3 categories to avoid
  excessive white space
- changed default IP for tftpserver
- added support for Serverlink SLP-SPP1008 power controller
- added config option TPCONF_power_ctrl_type to select type of power
  controller
- added task for initial setup of hosts (not included in public release)
- Added automatic topology config first version. Set TPCONF_config_topology 
  to '1' to enable. If enabled it will set the IPs configures in
  TPCONF_host_internal_ip on the testbed network interfaces and move 
  host into the right VLAN by changing the port configuration on the
  switch (only tested on Dell switch).
- init_os will now expand the OS list if OS list shorter than number of
  hosts by cloning the last entry in list. Allows to reboot several machines
  into same OS specifying it only once
- you can now specify 'running' or 'current' for TPCONF_linux_kern_router
  or TPCONF_linux_kern_hosts. Specifying this means use the currently running
  kernel. You can only use this if machines already run Linux, otherwise it
  has no effect! 
- added environment variable POINT_SIZE to control the point size on
  plots (default = 0.5)
- added TPCONF_os_partition to define the partition from which to boot the
  different OS in the config file
- all pxe boot and power control options can now be omitted from the
  config file 
- modified point thinning function. now checks x-axis and y-axis distance 
  separately. PTHIN_DIST_FAC defines the minimum absolute distance on x-axis 
  (PTHIN_DIST_FAC*XRANGE) or y-axis (PTHIN_DIST_FAC*YRANGE) point needs to have
  to previous point to be plotted. Alternatively, PTHIN_DIST can be used to 
  specify an absolute distance for backwards compatibility (however the result may
  vary slightly from the previous behaviour).
- added checking of host names and OS names in TPCONF_host_os. Host names
  must be names specified in TPCONF_router or TPCONF_hosts.
- TFTP server can now be configured in config.py via TPCONF_tftpserver and
  TFTP server can now be specified when running init_os with the tftp_server
  parameter.
- Fixed check if Linux kernel is correct after reboot
- added TPCONF_topology_switch, TPCONF_topology_switch_port_prefix and
  TPCONF_topology_switch_port_offset config parameters to control switch
  port prefix and port offset parameters for topology configuration

Version 0.7 (November 2014)
---------------------------
- Added TPCONF_debug_level config file variable to specify the level of
  debugging output. Setting it to 0 means no debugging output while setting
  it to 1 or higher means more and more debugging output. Currently only
  used to determine if .Rout files are created (level 1+) or not. 
- Added functionality for optional broadcast/multicast ping  on control
  interfaces. The pings are received by all hosts and logged by tcpdump. 
  They can be used later to compute the time offsets between hosts.
  The new variable TPCONF_bc_ping_enable enables the sending of the pings
  and the tcpdumps on all hosts if set to '1'.
- The new variable TPCONF_bc_ping_rate allows to control the rate of the
  broadcast pings. By default the rate 1 ping per second.
- The new variable TPCONF_bc_ping_address allows to define a multicast
  group to which the pings are sent. If this variable is not specified
  or it is empty, the pings will be broadcasted to the control networks
  broadcast address. 
- Added get_clock_offsets task. Can be used to generate files with all
  hosts clock offsets over time relative to one host (which by default
  is the router. The file name is <test ID>_clock_offsets.txt 
  Requires tcpdumps with the broadcast pings captured on control
  interfaces.
- Added ts_correct parameter for analyse_all, analyse_dash_goodput, 
  analyse_cmpexp, analyse_cwnd, analyse_throughput, analyse_rtt, 
  analyse_tcp_rtt, analyse_tcp_stat. If set to '1' functions will
  plot data with timestamps corrected according to the clock offset
  data. By default this is set to '0' and hence disabled.
- Removed any nslookup from code, all lookups are now done on
  control host with Python gethostbyname
- Added support for running proper NTP on Windows instead of the
  Windows time service (mainly logging using ntpq)
- Added task analyse_incast() to plot response time for incast experiments
  over time and as distributions (boxplots). The task has the standard
  parameters plus two new parameters. If boxplot is set to '1' instead
  of separate lines for each flow, all flows for one experiment are
  plotted as distribution/boxplot (by default this is '0'). If slowest_only
  is set to '1' instead of separate lines for each flow it will print
  the slowest response time for each point in time for all flows of
  one experiment (but one slowest line for each experiment).
- Added parameter io_filter for analyse_cwnd, analyse_tcp_rtt, 
  analyse_tcp_stat and analyse_all. Allows to specify whether TCP statistics 
  are plotted based on incoming ('i'), outgoing ('o') or incoming
  and outgoing packets ('io'). The default is 'io'. The parameters is
  only effective for FreeBSD/SIFTR log files, it does nothing for web10g
  log files. Also, the parameter only takes effect if replot_only='0'.
- Various changes to support Mac OX X
- Added TPCONF_web10g_poll_interval variable to control the web10g
  poll interval (Linux and Windows). The interval is specified in
  milliseconds. The default value is 10ms. The minimum value is 1ms.
  The maximum value is 1 second.
  Note that with small intervals, the actual interval is not very accurate
  and likely to be significantly larger than the specified value. 
  Note: It is unclear if Windows can do <10ms intervals.
- For all analyse tasks, if replot_only=1 data files are now generated
  if they do not exist yet (but if they already exist they are not 
  regenerated as before). If replot_only=0 then all data files are 
  generated as before. 
- added out_dir parameter for get_clock_offsets

Version 0.6 (9 September 2014)
-------------------
- Added environment variable to control the point thinning for plot.
  Using PTHIN_DIST one can set the minimum distance between plotted
  points. For example, PTHIN_DIST=0.25 means the minimum (euclidean) distance
  between two points is 0.25.
- Turned point thinning off by default to avoid missing something.
  Previously it was enabled by default with distance=0.25, so the
  previous default can be achieved setting PTHIN_DIST=0.25.
- Implemented 'pdf_dir' parameter for analyse_cmpexp, analyse_all, analyse_cwnd, 
  analyse_rtt, analyse_tcp_rtt, analyse_tcp_stat, analyse_throughput
  that specifies the directory in which the PDF files (figures) are
  created.
- Implemented out_name and pdf_dir parameters for analyse_dash_goodput
- Fixed bug that caused wlog, lighttpd.conf and generate_http_*_content.sh
  files to be created the fabfile directory instead of in the experiment 
  sub directories.
- Implemented ymin, ymax, stime, etime parameters for analyse_dash_goodput
- pdf_dir is now relative to the experiment directory
- dash_log_list can now be list of only the file names without path info,
  analyse_dash_goodput will find the full path names itself
- Added NO_NOMINAL environment variable for plot_dash_goodput, if set
  to 1 the nominal goodput won't be plotted
- source_filter can now handle wildcard character '*' instead of port
  number; this means filter only source/destination X with any port number
- added parameter 'method' to copy_file. Can be set to put (use Fabric put
  to copy or scp (use scp to copy). scp is faster, but requires password
  input if no public key authentication is configured
- added stime and etime parameters for analyse_cmpexp, so we can plot
  distributions for specified time windows, instead of over whole experiments
- out_name parameter for analyse_cmpexp now also allows to specify the 
  file name prefix (consistent with out_name for other functions);
  previously it changed some middle part of the file name

Version 0.5 (1 July 2014)
-------------------------
- Now do clock sync check after all other sanity checks (check_time_sync)
- Linux kernel to boot is now configurable via the config file.
  TPCONF_linux_kern_router specifies the kernel on the router, 
  TPCONF_linux_kern_hosts specifies the kernel on all other hosts.
  The name is the kernel image name minus the starting vmlinuz-, e.g.
  TPCONF_linux_kern_router = '3.14.5-vanilla-10000hz'
  TPCONF_linux_kern_hosts = '3.9.8-desktop-web10g'
- Maximum allowed time difference between machines in seconds can be
  configured now, e.g. TPCONF_max_time_diff = 1
- Added a parameter link_len for analyse_throughput and analyse_all tasks.
  If set to '0' (default) throughput is based on IP-layer length, if set to
  '1' throughput is based on link-layer length. Note that bandwidths limits
  specified on router are link-layer limits.
- Added parameter 'kill' to start_iperf(). By default this is '0'
  and iperf client will terminate after duration seconds. If this is set to
  '1' iperf client will be killed approx. 1 second after duration (this
  is to work around a "feature" in iperf that prevents it from stopping after
  the specified duration). To really shut iperf up, the iperf server is also
  killed approx. 2 seconds after duration.
- Force a start and resync of the Windows NTP client in sanity checks
- Increased delay after reboot to 30 seconds (XXX make configurable?)
- Fixed bug that configured Win7 to use the default TCP instead of Compound 
  when ECN=0. Now 'compound' selects Compound TCP and 'newreno' selects the
  default TCP fow Win7.
- For Windows hosts always try to enable test network interfaces in test_host(), 
  so they are up for the connectivity check
- Disable TCP window scaling heuristics for Windows
- Enable TCP timestamps for Windows
- Added stime and etime parameters for analyse_all, analyse_cwnd,
  analyse_rtt, analyse_tcp_rtt, analyse_tcp_stat, analyse_throughput.
  stime defines the start time of the period of interest to plot relative to
  the experiment start time (default 0.0) and etime defines the end time of
  the period of interest to plot relative to the experiment start time (default
  0.0 which here means the end time of the experiment). This is actually a 
  zoom no data is filtered. y-axis max is adjusted but legend is not adjusted, 
  use source_filter to remove entries of flows not in window.
- Added functionality to plot different experiments on same time plot. One
  can now specify a list of test ids with the test_id parameter. The test ids
  must be separated by semicolons. The extension is fully backwards-compatible,
  i.e. just specifying a single test id will give the old behaviour. If multiple
  ids are specified the pdfs will be created in the sub directory of the test
  id specified first! If multiple experiments are plotted on the same graph(s) 
  the file name(s) will be the _first_ test id specified followed by the string
  "_comparison" to distinguish from graphs where only one experiment is plotted.
- Added out_name parameter for analyse_all, analyse_cwnd,
  analyse_rtt, analyse_tcp_rtt, analyse_tcp_stat, analyse_throughput.
  If out_name is specified the prefix for the pdf files is out_name followed 
  by the test id (followed by "_comparison" for comparison graphs).
- If we start experiment with resume=1, it doesn't abort anymore if the
  file experiments_completed.txt does not exist (will be created after first
  experiment).
- Added ymin switch to allow user to define y-axis min for plots for
  analyse_cmpexp, analyse_cwnd, analyse_rtt, analyse_tcp_rtt, analyse_tcp_stat, 
  analyse_throughput

Version 0.4.9 (27 May 2014)
---------------------------
- fixed vertical grid lines for analyse_cmpexp
- added OUTLIER_QUANT variable for analyse_cmpexp 
  (<OUTLIER_QUANT and > 1 - OUTLIER_QUANT quantile values will be removed) 
- better x-axis labels for analyse_cmpexp
  - new boolean parameter omit_const_xlab_vars for analyse_cmpexp, set to '1'
    any variables that have been constant are omitted from the x-axis labels
    (default is '0') 
  - NICER_XLABS=1 env variable will plot variable names only once (left) and
    only plot variables values at each tick 
- Exposed aggregation window size and aggregation interpolation steps for
  throughput calculation as environment variables, so one can tweak them as
  needed. One can specify both using AGGR_WIN_SIZE (window size in seconds)
  and AGGR_INT_FACTOR (=1 means no interpolation, =n>1 means we get n times the
  points so n-1 times interpolated points). These work for analyse_throughput
  and analyse_cmpexp.
- filtered tcpdumps used by spp are now deleted after use
- added lnames parameter to specify legend names for analyse_all, analyse_rtt
  analyse_throughput, analyse_tcp_rtt, analyse_tcp_stat
- added simple time synchronisation check (checks whether testbed hosts are
  roughly synchronised with control host running fab)
- .start files are now created in experiment sub directories

Version 0.4.8 (23 April 2014)
-----------------------------
- renamed YMAX_FAC to YMAX_INC
- fixed bug in sub directory organisation introduced in version 0.4.7
  (.ipxe files not in sub directory)
- file prefix for .ipxe files changed to test ID prefix and not full test ID
- changed the tcp cc algo configuration syntax from host_<N> to host<N> 
  (underscore removed to improve parsing of file names)
- all underscores in parameter values used in file names are changed to hyphens
  again to improve parsing of file names (e.g. fq_codel will be fq-codel)

Version 0.4.7 (16 April 2014)
-----------------------------
- added Grenville to AUTHORS
- added ChangeLog
- fixed bug in plots that caused legend to be too low in case of single data
  series
- made y-axis max increase factor an environment variable (YMAX_FAC)
- store all files for one experiment under <test ID prefix> sub directory;
